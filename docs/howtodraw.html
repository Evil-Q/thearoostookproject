        <h1 class="arootext">Aroostook's pretty simple, as characters go. This means he's pretty easy to draw! Here's a slightly simplified version of how I go about drawing him. Of course, I encourage you to take as many creative libreties as you like!</h1>

    <img src="/Media/howto.png" alt="A step-by-step guide on how to draw Aroostook. Draw two circles with two semicircles inside, then fill in the semicircles. The draw two C's facing each other touching the eyes. Connect the bottoms of the C's and draw a line between the eyes. Draw an oval up and to the left of the left eye. Then draw the top of the head and add a rectangle window. Then add part of another oval behind the head. Then draw two ovals to the left of the left eye and two partial ovals below the smile. Draw backwards C's in the left ovals with another C inside. Fill in the right tires. Draw the back, including a line under the tires. Draw a rectangle window. Draw a small oval below the window for a handle and a rectangular L behind the back for the tailpipe." class="howto" />
