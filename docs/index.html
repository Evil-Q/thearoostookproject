    <p class="whatistext">The Aroostook Project is a mental health mission created by me, Evie! I give small, handmade
        drawings of Aroostook (the green car pictured above!) to people who aren't having a good day, are going through
        something hard, or just look like they need a little cartoon car to look at.<br /><img src="/Media/aroowave.png" alt="Aroostook waving." id="aroowave" /><br />
        The Aroostook Project also acts as a small fundraiser. Most of the proceeds go to charity, though a portion does support me and keeps the site running.
        <br><img src="./Media/aroodrive.png" alt="Aroostook driving." id="aroodrivehome" /><br>
        The purpose of the Aroostook Project is to show that there's always something you can do if someone's in distress, even if it's just a small gesture. Ask how they're doing, include them, or if you like, check out the links up top to draw your own Aroostook!
