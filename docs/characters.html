        <h1 class="arootext">Aroostook was the first of his friends, and later I created more characters based on transportation for an art project. He's a friendly green car that usually only says "beep beep!"</h1>

        <h1 class="righttext">Bici is a purple bike who's Aroostook's best friend. She is quite the daredevil, often pushing Aroostook to take risks (for better or for worse!).</h1>

        <h1 class="lefttext">Sparky is a maroon and gold train. They can only go where their tracks go, but that's still a pretty big area! They're very friendly, but watch out in case they accidentally spew fire and sparks (hence their name).</h1>

        <h1 class="righttext">Tug, a gigantic steamship, is a bit grumpy and only stays in the water (well- he's a boat, he couldn't very well go anywhere else). He's the largest of Aroostook and Co.</h1>
